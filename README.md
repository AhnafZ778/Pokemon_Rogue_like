A Pokemon Rogue like but on your terminal of choice :D

==========================================================
Wanted to get familiar with APIs and understand
Python functions and stuff a bit more indepth and 
had some very key learnings which are

◉ Asyncio helps you to do multiple  API calls without needing
to wait for one to finish which drastically changed time needed
for the battle to commence from 193.5 seconds to 20 seconds which 
is an insane upgrade

◉ Learnt how to import functions from other directories

◉ Wrote a lot of test codes through out which helped me understand 
how to test codes better

◉ Interacted alot with JSON files allowing me to attain a very high 
understanding of how to interact with them to get the information I want 
out from it
